## Comment & Output Restraint

Keep output and code/doc comments minimal and purposeful.

- Do NOT add progress logs, narrative explanations, or meta commentary to source code, docs, tests, or commit diffs.
- No autogenerated banners or markers like "Generated by".
- Never use emojis in code, comments, documentation, or commit messages.
- Inline comments only when they clarify non-obvious intent, business rules, performance trade-offs, or security rationale. Omit comments that restate the code.
- Remove obsolete/stale comments when changing related code.
- Avoid speculative TODOs; only leave a TODO if it is immediately actionable, clearly scoped, and required. Prefer creating a tracked issue instead.
- Do not insert review-style remarks ("nit:", "consider:") inside committed files.
- Keep examples free of progress chatter—only the example code and essential annotations.

---

## Workflow Principles

- **Correctness first** → Prioritize correctness, then readability/maintainability, then performance.
- **Reflect before acting** → After tool results, briefly summarize insights, list next options, and pick the best one.
- **Parallelize independent steps** → Run unrelated reads/checks in parallel to maximize efficiency.
- **No leftovers** → Remove temporary files/scripts/debug outputs before finishing. Keep `git status` clean aside from intended changes.
- **Ask when unsure** → If requirements are ambiguous, seek clarification rather than guessing.
- **Well-supported dependencies** → Prefer widely used, well-documented libraries with active maintenance. Ask permission before adding new dependencies.
- **Security first** → Never exfiltrate secrets; avoid network calls unless explicitly required. Do not log PII or secrets.
- **After editing code** → Run `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, and `golangci-lint run ./...` to ensure build/test/lint compliance.

## Project Overview

Huma Playground is a minimal REST API skeleton built with [Huma](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/huma) running on top of Chi via `humachi`. It demonstrates structured logging, consistent response envelopes, and a modular route layout.

### Key Features

- Chi middleware stack with CORS, request IDs, real IP detection, panic recovery, and structured access logs
- Request-scoped Zap logger with Google Cloud trace metadata enrichment
- Consistent `data/meta/error` envelopes for every response via generics
- Unified response helpers for success, redirects, and errors

### Tech & Tooling

- Language/runtime: Go 1.25+
- Frameworks/libs: Huma v2, Chi v5, Zap, go-chi/cors
- Testing: Go standard `testing` package

---

## Setup

### Requirements

- Go 1.25+

### Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

### Build

```bash
go build -v ./...
```

### Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

The server starts on port 8080 with endpoints:
- `http://localhost:8080/health` – health probe
- `http://localhost:8080/docs` – interactive API explorer
- `http://localhost:8080/openapi.json` – OpenAPI schema

---

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
go test -v -covermode=atomic -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

Generate coverage report:

```bash
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

---

## Linting

The project uses [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for static analysis and code formatting. Configuration is defined in `.golangci.yml`.

Run linter:

```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
```

Fix formatting issues automatically:

```bash
golangci-lint run --fix ./...
```

## Project Structure

```
cmd/server/           # Application entrypoint and HTTP server bootstrap
internal/api/         # Shared envelope and response types (Envelope, Meta, ErrorBody)
internal/common/      # Shared logger construction
internal/middleware/  # Request logging middleware and context helpers
internal/respond/     # Centralized response helpers for consistent envelopes
internal/routes/      # Route registration grouped by domain
```

---

## Coding Conventions

### Response Envelopes

All API responses must use the shared envelope format defined in `internal/api/envelope.go`:

```go
type Envelope[T any] struct {
    Data  *T         `json:"data"`
    Meta  Meta       `json:"meta"`
    Error *ErrorBody `json:"error"`
}
```

- `data`: primary payload (pointer so `null` is explicit)
- `meta`: shared metadata including `traceId`
- `error`: populated only on failure

### Error Handling

- Use `respond.Error(...)` for error responses to maintain consistency
- Error messages default to human-friendly text
- The helper will log with the appropriate level and clone detail slices

### Logging

Use context-aware logging helpers from `internal/middleware`:

```go
appmiddleware.LogInfo(ctx, "message", zap.String("key", "value"))
appmiddleware.LogWarn(ctx, "message", zap.String("key", "value"))
appmiddleware.LogError(ctx, "message", err, zap.String("key", "value"))
appmiddleware.LogFatal(ctx, "message", err, zap.String("key", "value"))
```

These helpers preserve contextual fields such as trace IDs.

### Adding New Routes

1. Create a new file under `internal/routes` (e.g., `users.go`)
2. Define your handler using Huma and return the appropriate envelope type
3. Add a registration function and call it from `routes.Register`
4. Log within handlers using context-aware helpers
5. Return errors with `respond.Error(...)` for consistency
6. Use `respond.Success` / `respond.WriteRedirect` helpers for responses

### Handler Pattern

```go
func registerMyRoute(api huma.API) {
    huma.Get(api, "/my-route", func(ctx context.Context, _ *struct{}) (*respond.Body[myData], error) {
        appmiddleware.LogInfo(ctx, "my route", zap.String("path", "/my-route"))
        resp := respond.Success(ctx, myData{...})
        return &resp, nil
    })
}
```

### JSON Encoding

- JSON responses are UTF-8 with HTML escaping disabled
- Response bodies include a `$schema` pointer to the JSON Schema

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- Tests are colocated with source files using `_test.go` suffix
- Use Go's standard `testing` package
- Create test servers using Chi router and Huma

### Test Pattern

```go
func TestMyFeature(t *testing.T) {
    respond.Install()
    router := chi.NewRouter()
    router.Use(
        appmiddleware.RequestID(),
        chimiddleware.RealIP,
        appmiddleware.RequestLogger(),
        respond.Recoverer(),
    )
    api := humachi.New(router, huma.DefaultConfig("Test", "test"))
    routes.Register(api)

    req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/endpoint", nil)
    req.Header.Set(chimiddleware.RequestIDHeader, "test-trace-id")
    resp := httptest.NewRecorder()
    router.ServeHTTP(resp, req)

    // Verify response
    if resp.Code != http.StatusOK {
        t.Fatalf("expected 200 OK, got %d", resp.Code)
    }

    var env apiinternal.Envelope[myData]
    if err := json.Unmarshal(resp.Body.Bytes(), &env); err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("failed to decode envelope: %v", err)
    }
    // Assert envelope fields...
}
```

### Coverage Requirements

- Tests should cover success paths, error paths, and edge cases
- Verify response envelopes contain expected data, meta, and error fields
- Test trace ID propagation through the request context

---

## Testing & Testability

- **NEVER add test-related code to production code.** No `if testing` branches, no test flags, no mock injection points.
- If code is not unit testable, refactor it. Use dependency injection, extract interfaces, or restructure — do not pollute production code with test scaffolding.
- Tests belong in `*_test.go` files; production code must remain test-agnostic.

---

## Secrets & Environment Variables

- Never commit secrets. Use environment variables for configuration.
- Access config through environment variables; don't hardcode secrets in business logic.
- Don't log secrets or PII; ensure logs redact sensitive fields.
- Typical env vars:
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GCP_PROJECT`, `GCLOUD_PROJECT`, or `PROJECT_ID` (for Cloud Trace correlation)

---

## Restrictions

- Never commit secrets or sensitive data
- Do not modify `go.mod` or `go.sum` without explicit request
- Keep response envelope structure consistent across all endpoints
- Always use the centralized `respond` package for API responses
- Do not add new dependencies without justification

---

## Agent Execution Guardrails

- Reflect on tool results and pick the best next action before proceeding.
- Prefer batching independent read-only steps in parallel; avoid redundant reads.
- Clean up temporary files/scripts before finishing a task.
- Do not invent paths/APIs/commands—verify from repo or tooling.
- For runnable code changes, run minimal tests to validate, report PASS/FAIL succinctly, and iterate up to three targeted fixes if needed.
